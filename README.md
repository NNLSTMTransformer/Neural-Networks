# Neural-Networks
This repository contains implementations of CNN, LSTM, and Transformer models for audio spoofing detection, trained and tested on the ASVSpoof 2019 LA dataset. The project was developed as part of a coursework assignment, focusing on benchmarking different neural architectures for anti-spoofing in speech systems.

Key Features:
Models:

  CNN: Convolutional Neural Network for spectrogram-based spoofing detection.

  LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory network for sequential audio analysis.

  Transformer: Self-attention-based model for capturing long-range dependencies.

Dataset: ASVSpoof 2019 Logical Access (LA) partition.

Environment: Implemented in Google Colab (PyTorch).

Purpose: Comparative evaluation of deep learning approaches for voice spoofing detection.
